\description{
High-level functions for managing content.
Publish an object on a member node
}
\details{
Use sensible defaults to publish an object on a member node. If identifier is provided,
use it, otherwise generate a UUID.  If clone_id is provided, then retrieve the
system metadata for that identifier and use it to provide rightsHolder, accessPolicy,
and replicationPolicy metadata. Note that this function only uploads the object to
the Member Node, and does not add it to a data package, which can be done separately.
